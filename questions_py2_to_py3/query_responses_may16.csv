"How do I merge two dictionaries in a single expression in Python?
<p>I want to merge two dictionaries into a new dictionary.</p>
<pre><code>x = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
y = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
z = merge(x, y)

&gt;&gt;&gt; z
{'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
</code></pre>
<p>Whenever a key <code>k</code> is present in both dictionaries, only the value <code>y[k]</code> should be kept.</p>
","
To merge two dictionaries in a single expression in Python, you can use the update() method. This method takes in another dictionary as an argument and merges it with the current dictionary. Any keys that are present in both dictionaries will have their values overwritten by the value in the second dictionary.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates this:

<pre><code>+def merge(x, y):
+    z = x.copy()
+    z.update(y)
+    return z
+
+def main():
+    x = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
+    y = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
+    z = merge(x, y)
+
+    print(z) # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
+
+main()
+</code></pre>

So in this case, the value for the key 'b' in the resulting dictionary will be 3, as it was overwritten by the value in the second dictionary.

Hope this helps!","<pre><code>x = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
y = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
z = merge(x, y)

&gt;&gt;&gt; z
{'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
</code></pre>
<p>If you are using Python 3.5 or above, you can use the <code>**</code> operator to merge two dictionaries in a single expression. This operator unpacks the key-value pairs from a dictionary into another dictionary.</p>
<pre><code>z = {**x, **y}

&gt;&gt;&gt; z
{'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}

"Search and replace a line in a file in Python
<p>I want to loop over the contents of a text file and do a search and replace on some lines and write the result back to the file. I could first load the whole file in memory and then write it back, but that probably is not the best way to do it.</p>

<p>What is the best way to do this, within the following code?</p>

<pre><code>f = open(file)
for line in f:
    if line.contains('foo'):
        newline = line.replace('foo', 'bar')
        # how to write this newline back to the file

f = open(file)
for line in f:
    if 'foo' in line:  # Use 'in' operator to check if 'foo' is in line

        # Use fileinput module to replace line in file
        for line in fileinput.input(file, inplace=True):
            print(newline)
    else:
        print(line)","
One way to do this is to use the fileinput module, which allows you to iterate over the lines in a file and modify them in-place:

<pre><code>import fileinput

# specify the file to be modified
filename = ""file.txt""

# loop over the lines in the file and replace 'foo' with 'bar'
for line in fileinput.input(filename, inplace=True):
    print(line.replace('foo', 'bar'), end='')
</code></pre>

The `inplace=True` argument tells fileinput to write the modified lines back to the original file.

Alternatively, you could use the `write()` method of a file object to write the modified lines to a new file, and then rename the new file to replace the original:

<pre><code>import os

# specify the file to be modified
filename = ""file.txt""

# create a new file for writing
new_filename = ""file_modified.txt""
new_file = open(new_filename, 'w')

# loop over the lines in the file and replace 'foo' with 'bar'
with open(filename) as f:
    for line in f:
        if line.contains('foo'):
            newline = line.replace('foo', 'bar')

"Finding a file in a Python module distribution
<p>I've written a Python package that includes a bsddb database of pre-computed values for one of the more time-consuming computations.  For simplicity, my setup script installs the database file in the same directory as the code which accesses the database (on Unix, something like /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/mypackage/).</p>

<p>How do I store the final location of the database file so my code can access it?  Right now, I'm using a hack based on the <code>__file__</code> variable in the module which accesses the database:</p>

<pre>
dbname = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), ""database.dat"")
</pre>

<p>It works, but it seems... hackish.  Is there a better way to do this?  I'd like to have the setup script just grab the final installation location from the distutils module and stuff it into a ""dbconfig.py"" file that gets installed alongside the code that accesses the database.</p>
","
The best way to find a file in a Python module distribution is to use the `pkg_resources` module from the `setuptools` package. This module allows you to find files in your package's distribution without relying on the `__file__` variable. Here's an example of how you can use it:

<pre>
import pkg_resources

# Get the absolute path to the package's distribution
pkg_dist = pkg_resources.get_distribution('mypackage')

# Use the `resource_filename` function to get the absolute path to your file
dbname = pkg_resources.resource_filename(pkg_dist, 'mypackage/database.dat')
</pre>

This approach is cleaner and more reliable than using the `__file__` variable, as it takes into account any changes in the package's installation location.","
One option could be to use the built-in <code>pkg_resources</code> module, which is part of the setuptools package. This module allows you to access files and resources within a package, even if it is not in its original location. Here's an example of how you could use it to access your database file:

<pre>
import pkg_resources

# get the distribution object for your package
dist = pkg_resources.get_distribution('mypackage')

# use the resource_filename method to get the full path to your database file
dbname = pkg_resources.resource_filename(dist, 'database.dat')
</pre>

This should work regardless of where your package is installed. Just make sure to include the setuptools package in your setup script so that the <code>pkg_resources</code> module is available when your package is installed.

Another option could be to use the <code>sys.prefix</code> variable, which contains the path to the root of the Python installation. From there, you could construct the path to your database file using something like <code>os.path.join(sys.prefix, 'lib', 'python2.5', 'site-packages', 'mypackage', 'database.dat')</code>.

Ultimately, the best approach may depend on your specific use case and how",
"Finding what methods a Python object has
<p>Given a Python object of any kind, is there an easy way to get the list of all methods that this object has?</p>
<p>Or if this is not possible, is there at least an easy way to check if it has a particular method, other than checking if an error occurs when the method is called?</p>
","
Yes, there is an easy way to get the list of all methods that a Python object has. You can use the `dir()` function to get a list of all attributes and methods of an object. Here's an example:

```python
obj = SomeClass()
print(dir(obj))
```

This will print out a list of all methods and attributes that `obj` has. However, this will also include built-in methods and attributes, so you may need to filter out those. 

Alternatively, if you want to check if a particular method exists on an object, you can use the `hasattr()` function. Here's an example:

```python
obj = SomeClass()
if hasattr(obj, 'some_method'):
    # do something
else:
    # do something else
```

Keep in mind that this will only check for the existence of the method, not whether it can be called successfully.","
Yes, there are a few ways to find the methods of a Python object:

1. The dir() function:
The dir() function returns a list of all the attributes and methods of an object. This includes built-in methods as well as user-defined methods. For example:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(dir(my_list))
```
Output:
```
['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__', '__delitem__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__iadd__', '__imul__', '__init__', '__iter__', '__le__', '__len__', '__lt__', '__mul__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__reversed__', '__rmul__', '__setattr__', '__setitem__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', 'append', 'clear', 'copy', 'count', 'extend', 'index', 'insert', 'pop', 'remove', 'reverse', 'sort']

"Replacement for for... if array iteration
<p>I love list comprehensions in Python, because they concisely represent a transformation of a list.</p>

  if (x &gt; 3) //generic condition on x

</code></pre>

<p>This example is in C#, where I'm under the impression LINQ can help with this, but is there some common programming construct which can replace this slightly less-than-elegant solution?  Perhaps a data structure I'm not considering?</p>
","
In Python, you can use the built-in `filter` function to achieve a similar result without using a list comprehension. The `filter` function takes in a function and an iterable, and returns an iterator containing only the elements from the iterable that pass the function's condition.

Here's an example of how you could use `filter` to achieve the same result as the C# code snippet:

```
# Define a function that checks if the element is greater than 3
def check_condition(x):
    return x > 3

# Use filter to iterate through the array and filter out elements that don't pass the condition
filtered_array = filter(check_condition, int_array)

# Use a for loop to increment the elements in the filtered array and perform other processing
for x in filtered_array:
    x += 1
    # Do other processing
```

This code snippet uses a generator expression to create a filtered iterator, which is more efficient than creating a list comprehension. It may not be as concise as a list comprehension, but it is a common and efficient solution in Python.","
One possible solution could be to use the built-in filter function in Python, which allows you to apply a condition to a list and return a new list with the filtered elements. Then, you can use a list comprehension to perform the transformation on the filtered list. Here's an example:

<pre><code>intArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# filter elements greater than 3
filteredArray = filter(lambda x: x &gt; 3, intArray)

# perform transformation on filtered elements
newArray = [x+1 for x in filteredArray]

print(newArray) # [5, 6]
</code></pre>

Another possible solution could be to use the map function in Python, which allows you to apply a function to each element in a list and return a new list with the transformed elements. Here's an example:

<pre><code>intArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# apply transformation to all elements
newArray = map(lambda x: x+1, intArray)

# filter elements greater than 3
filteredArray = filter(lambda x: x &gt; 3, newArray)

"Python version of PHP's stripslashes
<p>I wrote a piece of code to convert PHP's striplashes into valid Python [backslash] escapes:</p>

cleaned = cleaned.replace('\\', '')
</code></pre>

<p>How can I condense it? </p>
","
You can use the built-in function `codecs.decode()` to decode the string with the specified encoding. In this case, the encoding we want to use is `unicode_escape`. This will automatically convert all backslash escapes into their corresponding characters.

Example:

```python
cleaned = codecs.decode(stringwithslashes, 'unicode_escape')
```

This will handle all the backslash escapes in one line of code, making it more concise and efficient.","
One possible way to condense this code is to use regular expressions to replace all occurrences of backslashes followed by a certain character with just that character. This can be done using the `re.sub()` function from the `re` module in Python:

<pre><code>import re
cleaned = re.sub(r'\\(.)', r'\1', stringwithslashes)
</code></pre>

This code uses the regular expression `\\(.)` to match any backslash followed by a single character, and then replaces it with just the captured character using the `\1` replacement string. This effectively removes all backslashes from the string and converts them into their corresponding characters.",
"How do you express binary literals in Python?

</code></pre>

<p><strong>How do you use literals to express binary in Python?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>Summary of Answers</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Python 2.5 and earlier: can express binary using <code>int('01010101111',2)</code> but not with a literal.</li>
<li>Python 2.5 and earlier: there is <em>no way</em> to express binary literals.</li>
<li>Python 2.6 beta: You can do like so: <code>0b1100111</code> or <code>0B1100111</code>.</li>
<li>Python 2.6 beta: will also allow <code>0o27</code> or <code>0O27</code> (second character is the letter O) to represent an octal.</li>
<li>Python 3.0 beta: Same as 2.6, but will no longer allow the older <code>027</code> syntax for octals.</li>
</ul>
","
To express a binary number as an integer literal in Python, you can use the prefix ""0b"" or ""0B"" followed by the binary digits. For example:

```python
0b101010 # 42
0B110011 # 51
```

This feature was introduced in Python 2.6 beta. In earlier versions, there was no way to express binary literals. However, you could use the `int()` function to convert a binary string to an integer:

```python
int('010101', 2) # 21
```

Note that this method is only available in Python 2.5 and earlier.

Python 3.0 beta also supports the ""0b"" and ""0B"" prefixes for binary literals, but it no longer allows the older syntax of using a leading ""0"" for octal numbers (e.g. 027). Instead, you can use the ""0o"" or ""0O"" prefixes for octal literals in Python 3.0 beta.

Overall, to express binary literals in Python, you can use the ""0b"" or ""0B"" prefixes for binary numbers and the ""0o"" or ""0O"" prefixes for octal numbers.","
<p>In summary, there are a few different ways to express binary literals in Python:</p>

<ul>
<li>Python 2.5 and earlier: Binary literals cannot be expressed directly using literals, but can be converted from strings using the <code>int()</code> function.</li>
<li>Python 2.6 beta: Binary literals can be expressed using the <code>0b</code> or <code>0B</code> prefix, followed by the binary number.</li>
<li>Python 2.6 beta: Octal literals can also be expressed using the <code>0o</code> or <code>0O</code> prefix, followed by the octal number.</li>
<li>Python 3.0 beta: Same as Python 2.6, but the older syntax for octal literals is no longer allowed.</li>

"ssh hangs when command invoked directly, but exits cleanly when run interactive
<p>I need to launch a server on the remote machine and retrieve the port number that the server process is lsitening on.  When invoked, the server will listen on a random port and output the port number on stderr.</p>

<p>I want to automate the process of logging on to the remote machine, launching the process, and retrieving the port number. I wrote a Python script called ""<code>invokejob.py</code>"" that lives on the remote machine to act as a wrapper that invokes the job and then returns the port number, it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>import re, subprocess
executable = ... # Name of executable
regex = ... # Regex to extract the port number from the output
p = subprocess.Popen(executable,
    bufsize=1, # line buffered
    stderr=subprocess.PIPE
    )
s = p.stderr.readline()
port = re.match(regex).groups()[0]
print port

$ ./invokejob.py
63409
$ exit
logout
Connection to remotehost.example.com closed.

<p>(Note: successful logout, it did not hang).</p>

<p>However, if I try to invoke it from the command-line, it just hangs:</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh remotehost.example.com invokejob.py
</code></pre>

<p>Does anybody know why it hangs in the second case, and what I can do to avoid this? </p>

<p>Note that I need to retrieve the output of the program, so I can't just use the ssh ""-f"" flag or redirect standard output.</p>
","
The reason why your script hangs when invoked from the command-line is because of the way you are using subprocess. Specifically, you are not providing a list of arguments, but instead passing the entire command as a single string. This can cause issues with how the command is executed and can lead to the script hanging. 

To fix this, you can use the following code snippet instead:

<pre><code>+import subprocess
+import re
+executable = ... # Name of executable
+regex = ... # Regex to extract the port number from the output
+p = subprocess.Popen([executable],
+    bufsize=1, # line buffered
+    stderr=subprocess.PIPE
+    )
+s = p.stderr.readline()
+port = re.match(regex).groups()[0]
+print(port)
+</code></pre>

This will ensure that the command is properly executed and the script won't hang. Additionally, since you are using Python 3, you should use ""print"" as a function instead of a statement. So the last line should be changed to:

<pre><code>+print(port)
</code></pre>

Hope this helps!","
<p>One possible explanation for this behavior is that when you run the script interactively, the <code>ssh</code> session is attached to a TTY (terminal), while when you invoke the script directly from the command-line, <code>ssh</code> does not allocate a TTY by default.</p>

<p>When a TTY is attached, the <code>invokejob.py</code> script is able to read and process the output from the <code>executable</code> process as it is generated. However, when <code>ssh</code> does not allocate a TTY, the output is buffered and not sent until the process completes, causing the script to hang.</p>

<p>To fix this, you can use the <code>-t</code> flag with <code>ssh</code> to force allocation of a TTY, like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh -t remotehost.example.com invokejob.py
</code></pre>

<p>This should allow the script to read and process the output as it is generated, avoiding the hang.</p>",

"Extending base classes in Python
<p>I'm trying to extend some ""base"" classes in Python:</p>

    def add(self, *args):

x += 5
print type(x)         ## &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;type 'int'&gt;  # Not ok (#2)

<p>It works fine in the <em>list</em> case because the <em>append</em> method modifies the object ""in place"", without returning it. But in the <em>int</em> case, the <em>add</em> method doesn't modify the value of the external <em>x</em> variable. I suppose that's fine in the sense that <em>self</em> is a local variable in the <em>add</em> method of the class, but this is preventing me from modifying the initial value assigned to the instance of the class.</p>

<p>Is it possible to extend a class this way or should I define a class property with the base type and map all the needed methods to this property?</p>
","
Yes, it is possible to extend a class in Python. You can do so by using the ""super"" function to call the parent class's method, as shown in the provided code snippet. This ensures that the parent class's method is still called, even after you have extended the class. Additionally, you can use the ""super"" function to access the parent class's attributes and methods, as shown in the provided code snippet.

In the provided code snippet, the ""build_extension"" method is being extended in the ""LazyBuilder"" class. This allows the code to handle CompileErrors in a specific way, and then call the parent class's ""build_extension"" method to handle all other cases. This type of extension can be used in any class that extends another class.

Another example of extending a base class is shown in the ""AsyncXMLRPCServer"" class. Here, the ""Thread"" class is being extended to create a custom XMLRPC server. This allows for additional functionality to be added on top of the base class's functionality.

In conclusion, extending base classes in Python is possible and can be done by using the ""super"" function to call the parent class's methods and access its attributes. This allows for custom functionality to be added to base classes without","
It is possible to extend a class in Python, but there are a few things you need to keep in mind:

1. When you extend a class, you are creating a new subclass, not just adding methods to an existing class. This means that you need to use the <code>super()</code> function to access methods from the base class.

2. When you extend a class, you can override existing methods or add new methods, but you cannot modify existing methods. In your example, you are trying to modify the <code>__add__()</code> method of the <em>int</em> class, which is not allowed.

3. In Python, integers are immutable objects, which means that they cannot be modified in-place. So even if you were able to modify the <em>add</em> method, it would still not modify the value of the external <em>x</em> variable. Instead, it would create a new integer object and return that.

To achieve the desired behavior, you could define a new class that inherits from <em>int</em> and overrides the <code>__add__()</code> method. Something like this:

    def __add",

The most Pythonic way to rewrite this C construct would be to use a for loop with the iter() function. This function takes two arguments, the first being the function to call repeatedly and the second being the sentinel value that indicates the end of the loop. The code would look like this:

<pre><code>for x in iter(next, END):
    ....

Note that this assumes you are using the same variable for both the return value of next() and the END value. If you need to use different variables, you can use a while loop with the assignment inside the condition:

<pre><code>while True:
    x = next()
    if x == END:
        break
    ....
